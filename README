An example app to demonstrate forms-angular - a way of creating forms in a
Angular / Bootstrap / Express application.

All the heavy lifting is shared between a controller (which speaks to the server
and converts the Mongoose schema to an internal schema) and a directive (which
generates the html for the form).

There is a demonstration application with several example schemas running at
http://forms-ng.herokuapp.com
